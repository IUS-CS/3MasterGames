# Spellviewer

### Decription - With this project we plan to create a windows application that allows a user to search a list of spells from an interchange-able resource so that the application can be changed. We also plan to have a search bar and filter so that the user can look at the spells that they want per level and Class for the RPG.

### Output Description - By selecting a spell it will automatically display a discription of the spell, damage and effect abilities, level and school the spell belongs to, the type of roll that is required, etc. All this information at the fingertips of the user. Making everything easily accessible.

### Expansions - In greatest possiblity to least- if we get done with the aformentioned description.

1) Add a Spellbook were the user can put there spesfic spells out of the total
list and keep track of there spell slots. (how many uses of a spell per level left)

2) Add an editor so that the user can make changes to the 
users application so that they can have there homebrew spells or classes in the application.

3) Be able to change out different RPG game systems.
