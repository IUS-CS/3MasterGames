# Project Reflections

## John:

### This project was a good learning experience for me. We started this project going in witht the mind of using C# a
language that none of us had alot of experience with. We encountered a few hiccups throughout the program, such as
the organization of our code. Instead of creating an organized program, and seperating logic, UI, infrastructure, and etc. 
we started to write the code more or less all together. By doing, this we now know the struggle and how painful it is
to try and change or update anything. By talking with people and searching the web, we learned better ways to organize
code. One of my roles in this project had been to take in the large XML file of spells and parsing them out into lists so that
we could organize the correct attributes with the right spell. I also helped out a little with filters and testing. Something
better that we could have done was better communication overall, we did great in the beginning, even had a agile meeting to evaluate
points for each task. If we kept up with that and organized our code better it would have been much easier. Overall this project was a 
great learning experience, and I would be glad to re-work on it.
