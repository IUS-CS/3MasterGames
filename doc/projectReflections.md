# Project Reflections

## John:
This project was a good learning experience for me. We started this project going in with the mind of using C# a
language that none of us had alot of experience with. We encountered a few hiccups throughout the program, such as
the organization of our code. Instead of creating an organized program, and separating logic, UI, infrastructure, and etc. 
we started to write the code more or less all together. By doing, this we now know the struggle and how painful it is
to try and change or update anything. By talking with people and searching the web, we learned better ways to organize
code. One of my roles in this project had been to take in the large XML file of spells and parsing them out into lists so that
we could organize the correct attributes with the right spell. I also helped out a little with filters and testing. Something
better that we could have done was better communication overall, we did great in the beginning, even had a agile meeting to evaluate
points for each task. If we kept up with that and organized our code better it would have been much easier. Overall this project was a 
great learning experience, and I would be glad to re-work on it.

## Zac:
I feel like this project was a success even though we did not get done everything we wanted. Not only was this a great experience, but I also learned a lot about C#. 
The only thing I want do differently is plan out the details more  of the different interacting class.
I worked on the organization of the project, creating the tasks and stories for the the project. 
Otherwise, in the code, I created all code to display data. I created a data formatter class that takes in a data row 
and returns a formated string. The issue I found with this is that we had our whole data layer all over UI layer and it created issue were 
our database was all over our code base. After this semester, I plan to make this project open source and continue working on it.

## Brandon
I thoroughly enjoyed this project and this class altogether probably taught me the most since I’ve started school. I learned a new language, and taught myself how to 
do good research to use tools I’ve never used before. Most of the project I worked on was filters. I created the UI for filters and I successfully implemented the 
filters for levels. One of the issues we ran into with this is filters with classes, whenever you have multiple filters checked, such as “bard” and “wizard”, it only
shows you classes with both bard and wizard. I believe this is because our classes were just one long, giant string and we probably should’ve refined how classes were
put into our spell class. Other than that I also worked on putting all of the spells into lists for the filter, and created the main filter function, the reset button,
and the function that tests if any checkboxes are checked.
