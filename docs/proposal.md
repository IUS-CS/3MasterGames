#Spellviewer

###Decription
	With this project we plan to create a windows application that allows a user
to search a list of spells from a interchange-able resource so that the application 
can be changed. We also plan to have a search bar and filter so that the user can
look at the spells that they want per level and Class for the RPG.

###Expansions - in greatest possiblity to least- if we get done with the aformentioned description

	1) add a Spellbook were the user can put there spesfic spells out of the total
list and keep track of there spell slots ( how many uses of a spell per level left)
	
	2) add an editor so that the user can make changes to the 
users application so that they can have there homebrew spells 
or classes in the application

	3) be able to change out different RPG game systems
